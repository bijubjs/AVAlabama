# Collocating Specialty Crops and Solar panels in Alabama, Southeastern USA
## Abstract
Agrivoltaic farm profitability in the southeastern US is poorly understood. We calculated the profitability of the tomato and strawberry agrivoltaics farms. We found that compensating 50\% capital expenditure costs through the Rural Energy for America Program makes agrivoltaics more attractive to producers but that at 25\% does not.
